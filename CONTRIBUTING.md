# Contributing to AleeBot
If you want to help me make AleeBot you must get NodeJS to make AleeBot work.
Include the GPL-3.0 license too.

# Testing the bot

First get NodeJS then clone this repo then do `npm install` in the AleeBot folder. Now add a file called `tokens.json` then copy and paste this follow code.
```
{
  "abtoken": "token"
}
```
Then get your token from discord and replace token with your token and finally run this in linux `./run_linux.sh` or for windows `run_win.bat`.
